        <p>
          Every Kaeorn order goes through careful quality checks before it
          leaves us. In the rare event that your product arrives damaged,
          defective, or incorrect, we'll make it right.
        </p>

        <p>
          To raise a concern, contact us within 48 hours of receiving your
          order with clear photos and unboxing video along with your order details. Once verified, we'll
          arrange a replacement or process a refund — whichever works best
          for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Approved refunds are returned to your original payment method within
          7–10 business days. Shipping charges, if any, are non-refundable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Orders that have already been shipped cannot be cancelled. If you
          need to make any changes, please reach out to us as early as
          possible after placing your order.
