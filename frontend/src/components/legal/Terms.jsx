        <p>
          By visiting and using the Kaeorn website, you agree to the terms
          outlined on this page. Please take a moment to read them — they're
          straightforward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Product descriptions, pricing, and availability are subject to change
          without prior notice. We do our best to keep everything accurate and
          up to date.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kaeorn reserves the right to refuse service, cancel orders, or
          limit purchase quantities where necessary — for example, in cases of
          suspected fraud or policy violations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Continued use of this website means you accept these terms as they
          stand. If anything changes significantly, we'll make sure it's
          clearly communicated.
