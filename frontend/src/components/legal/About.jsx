        <p>
          Kaeorn is a luxury perfume brand built on one belief — that a great
          scent shouldn't announce itself. It should settle into your skin,
          stay close, and become something people notice only when you've
          already left the room.
        </p>

        <p>
          We make Eau de Parfum for people who don't need to be loud about
          their taste. Every fragrance in the Kaeorn collection is composed
          around a feeling — not a trend, not a season. Woody, Gourmand, floral,
          spicy — chosen because they work on real skin, in real life.
        </p>

        <p>
          The name KAEORN brings together two ideas: to endure, and to
          radiate. It's the standard every bottle is held to. Crafted with
          care, made in India, and built to last far beyond the first wear.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because care deserves luxury. That's not just a tagline — it's the
          reason Kaeorn exists.
